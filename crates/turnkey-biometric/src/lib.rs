//! Biometric scanner device implementations for the Turnkey access control emulator.
//!
//! This crate provides biometric scanner implementations for production use.
//! For mock implementations used in development and testing, see the
//! `turnkey-hardware::mock` module.

// Currently empty - real hardware drivers will be added here

    #[test]
    fn test_crate_compiles() {
        // Placeholder test to ensure crate compiles correctly.
        // Real hardware tests will be added when hardware drivers are implemented.
